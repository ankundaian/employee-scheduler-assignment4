## Repository Link
https://github.com/ankundaian/employee-scheduler-assignment4

This repository contains the source code for **Python** and **JavaScript** implementations of the employee scheduling application with shift preferences.

---

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of various **control structures** in multiple programming languages. It handles:

1. **Employee scheduling** for 7 days of the week.  
2. Each employee can work a **maximum of 5 days** per week.  
3. Each shift (**Morning, Afternoon, Evening**) requires at least **2 employees**.  
4. Employees have **ranked shift preferences**
5. If a shift is under-staffed, additional employees are assigned randomly while respecting the 5-day limit.
